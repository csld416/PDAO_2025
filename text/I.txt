Okay, let's move on to the next question. 

The prestigious National Museum of Technology operates a high-tech security system based on NxN grids of laser sensors.
Each sensor has a unique power level used to detect intruders.
However, the chief security officer noticed that the power levels are unnecessarily high, leading to excessive energy consumption.

To optimize energy efficiency, the power levels must be reconfigured while preserving the system's effectiveness.
The new configuration must satisfy the following conditions. 

- If a sensor originally had a higher power level than another sensor in the same row or column,
it must remain more powerful in the new configuration. 
That is, let P' be the reconfigured security system of the original one P, 
then for all indices i, j_1, j_2, s.t. j_1 != j_2, and i is in the range from [0 to M), j_1, j_2 is in  [0 to N),
the following statement holds:

P'_{i, j_1} > P'_{i, j_2} <--> P_{i, j_1} > P_{i, j_2}

Similarly, for all indices, j, i_1, i_2, s.t. i_1 != i_2, i_1, i_2 in [0, M), j in [0, N), we have:

P'_{i_1, j} > P'_{i_2, j} <--> P_{i_1, j} > P_{i_2, j}

- the highest power level int he new configuration must be as low as possible.
- the minumunm power level un the new configuration must be at least 1.

As the museum security consultant, your task is to determine the optimal power levels for each sensor in the grid while ensuring that the consitions above are met.

Input:
line 1 contains two integers M and N, denoting the number of rows and columns in the security grid.

The next M lines each contains N integers, denoting the number of sensors in the grid and P denoting the power levels of sensors.

Each power level in the initial configuration is unique. 

constrainghts:
1 <= M,N <= 1e3
1 <= P <= 1e5
P_{i_1, j_1} != P_{i_2, j_2}, where(i1, j1) != (i2, j2)
M *  N <= 1e5


output
output M lines, each contatining N soace-seperated integers, denoting the reconfigured securoty grid.
